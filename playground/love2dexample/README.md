### Installing love

to run this example you must install love2d
https://love2d.org/

I set up this alias from my `~/.zshrc`

```
alias love="/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love"
```

so that I can call the `love` command from anywhere.

### run

in a directory with a `main.lua`

```
love .
```
